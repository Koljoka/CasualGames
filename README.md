## Project Structure

This project has the following structure:

│   └── [application package]
│       ├── base
│       │   └── ui
│       │       ├── ViewToolbar.java
│       │       └── MainLayout.java
│       ├── examplefeature
│       │   ├── ui
│       │   │   └── TaskListView.java
│       │   ├── Task.java
│       │   ├── TaskRepository.java
│       │   └── TaskService.java                
│       └── Application.java     
├── main/resources
│   ├── META-INF
│   │   └── resources

        └── examplefeature
           └── TaskServiceTest.java                 
```

The main entry point into the application is `Application.java`. This class contains the `main()` method that starts up 
the Spring Boot application.

The project follows a *feature-based package structure*, organizing code by *functional units* rather than traditional 
architectural layers. It includes two feature packages: `base` and `examplefeature`.

* The `base` package contains classes meant for reuse across different features, either through composition or 
  inheritance. You can use them as-is, tweak them to your needs, or remove them.
* The `examplefeature` package is an example feature package that demonstrates the structure. It represents a 
  *self-contained unit of functionality*, including UI components, business logic, data access, and an integration test.
  Once you create your own features, *you'll remove this package*.


## Starting in Development Mode

To start the application in development mode, import it into your IDE and run the `Application` class. 
You can also start the application from the command line by running: 

```bash
./mvnw
```

## Building for Production

To build the application in production mode, run:

```bash
./mvnw package
```

To build a Docker image, run:

```bash
docker build -t my-application:latest .
```

If you use commercial components, pass the license key as a build secret:

```bash
docker build --secret id=proKey,src=$HOME/.vaadin/proKey .
```

## Next Steps

The [Building Apps](https://vaadin.com/docs/v25/building-apps) guides contain hands-on advice for adding features to 
your application.
